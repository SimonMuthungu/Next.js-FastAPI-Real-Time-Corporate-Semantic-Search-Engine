⭐ Next.js-FastAPI-Real-Time-Corporate-Semantic-Search-Engine
This application processes corporate documents and leverages Generative AI (RAG) to provide real-time, cited answers and insights from your internal knowledge base. It transforms unstructured documents into a powerful, secure, and highly accurate semantic search experience.

🚀 Key Features
Real-Time Semantic Search: Go beyond keyword matching to understand the meaning and context of user queries.

Cited Answers (RAG): AI-generated responses are accompanied by exact document snippets for full transparency and verification.

Secure Document Ingestion: A robust backend pipeline for processing and embedding proprietary corporate documents.

Live Streamed Responses: Utilizes real-time capabilities for an instant, responsive, and modern user experience.

Scalable Architecture: Built on industry-leading frameworks for high performance and scalability

🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built on a scalable Full-Stack Generative AI (RAG) Architecture, designed for high performance and real-time data delivery.

🧠 AI & Data Pipeline
RAG Orchestration: LangChain & LangGraph manages the complex flow of document retrieval, question answering, and citation generation.

Vector Database: Pinecone & Weaviate Chroma store and enable high-speed semantic search across corporate documents.

Document Processing: LlamaIndex & pydantic handles data ingestion, chunking, embedding, and schema validation.

💻 Frontend & Backend Services
Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, & TypeScript deliver a fast, server-rendered, and type-safe user interface.

Backend API: FastAPI (Python) provides a high-performance, asynchronous API for serving search queries and managing the RAG pipeline.

Real-Time Streaming: WebSockets / Server-Sent Events (SSE) ensures a low-latency, real-time experience by streaming AI responses chunk-by-chunk.

Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling and rapid, responsive UI development.

☁️ Infrastructure & DevOps
Containerization: Docker ensures a consistent, reproducible, and scalable deployment environment for the backend.

Methodology: Agile/Scrum and DevOps principles guide the project workflow and continuous delivery.
